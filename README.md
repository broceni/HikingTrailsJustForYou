# HikingTrailsJustForYou

Feature #1 - Kalise Ball
The first one is I would like the app to gather the basic information from the user such as age, gender, daily activity level, etc depends on what you think would be a good factor to estimate their physical fitness level. Then, the gathered information will be used to estimate the user’s physical fitness level. You can design and define your own set of levels. I would say probably at least 3 or 4 levels.

Feature #3 - Evan McKague
Next, I would like to have any kind of UI, that you will be the one who design, allows the user to interact to enable the “best choice” feature. This will filter the result with the user’s physical fitness level and show only the matched trails. Users can also choose how they want to feel during their hike; “easy and chill”, “best match my fitness level” or “challenge me more!” This will affect the search results based on what the user select.

Feature #4 - Cliff Webb
I also wanted the app to guide me to the trailhead location by clicking the navigation button and bring me to Google Maps or any navigation providers.

Feature #5 - Nicholas Broce
Last but not least, I would love to get well prepared for my hiking by seeing the recommendation on what gears and clothing I should bring and wear. The recommendation will base on the current season and the type of the selected trail. For example, if the trail has a lot of inclined elevation gain, a hiking pole may be useful.
