# HikingTrailsJustForYou

Feature #5 - Nicholas Broce
Last but not least, I would love to get well prepared for my hiking by seeing the recommendation on what gears and clothing I should bring and wear. The recommendation will base on the current season and the type of the selected trail. For example, if the trail has a lot of inclined elevation gain, a hiking pole may be useful.
