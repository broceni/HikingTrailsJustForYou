# HikingTrailsJustForYou

Feature #1 - Kalise Ball
The first one is I would like the app to gather the basic information from the user such as age, gender, daily activity level, etc depends on what you think would be a good factor to estimate their physical fitness level. Then, the gathered information will be used to estimate the userâ€™s physical fitness level. You can design and define your own set of levels. I would say probably at least 3 or 4 levels.

Feature #5 - Nicholas Broce
Last but not least, I would love to get well prepared for my hiking by seeing the recommendation on what gears and clothing I should bring and wear. The recommendation will base on the current season and the type of the selected trail. For example, if the trail has a lot of inclined elevation gain, a hiking pole may be useful.
